Wentworth ELEC3225 Applied Programming Concepts Summer 2022 final project.

Replicate Antikythera

Synopsis: The Anitkythera device was an ancient Greek computer that simulated the events for
astronomical bodies (stars, planets, etc.). This project will be similar, tracking and predicting the
movement of various entities in space. It will have a recording of history and use mathematical and
time-based functions to track placement, reporting out interesting events (planets lining up, eclipses,
visibility from a place on Earth, etc.).

Required
+ Testing: test for certain events in history (alignments, eclipses), should be incremental; use
events we know have happened to calibrate.
+ Database: known past events, bodies in the galaxy/solar system (planets, moons, stars, comets,
asteroids).
+ Search/sort/data structure: searching event list by time, body, type of event.
+ ther functionality: Model solar system and all major bodies (not just planets), note eclipses,
alignments, best methods to travel from point A to point B given a time frame and travel
method, must be physically accurate; must have a UI (GUI optional) to allow reading of data
by a human user.
